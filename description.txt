Expressories is a Calamity additions mod aiming to add more to the rogue class

- 8 Rogue class-based Accessories

The aim of this mod is to add more variety and choice in the rogue class with the
current Rogue feeling set on a certain path and doesn't get more choice in Accessories and armor

plus there are not that  many mods that adds to calamity rogue class

Don't worry there are lots more Accessories and a few armor sets to come this is the first iteration of this mod

ALL ITEMS DONT HAVE RECIPES YET
I am having trouble making up recipes and where to put these items in the game so i have yet to implement this
this is my first mod I've made soo there are a lot of mistakes I will make, most of the sprites in the game are just reskins of Terraira sprites since i am not a good pixel artist
if you have any suggestion or thing I could improve I would  LOVE to hear them whether it be criticism or complements
